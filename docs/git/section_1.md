A Git project has three parts:

- A Working Directory: where files are created, edited, deleted, and organized
- A Staging Area: where changes that are made to the working directory are listed
- A Repository: where Git permanently stores changes as different versions of the project

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository.
