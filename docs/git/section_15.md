To commit changes in a Git repository, you can use the `git commit` command. It creates a new commit with the changes you have made and provides a commit message to describe the changes.

```bash
$ git commit -m "Updated index.html"
[main abcdefg] Updated index.html
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```
