To commit your code in Git, you need to follow these steps:
- Make changes to your files.
- Stage the changes using the `git add` command. For example, `git add file1.txt` or `git add .` to add all changes.
- Commit the changes using the `git commit` command along with a descriptive commit message. For example, `git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"`.

```bash
$ git add file1.txt
$ git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"
```
