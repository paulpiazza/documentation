Pull requests on GitHub are a way to propose changes to a repository hosted on GitHub. They allow you to submit your changes for review and merge them into another branch, typically the main branch.

To create a pull request on GitHub:
- Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
- Create a new branch based on the target branch.
- Make your changes and push them to your forked repository.
- Go to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request, specifying the source and target branches.

The pull request can then be reviewed by collaborators, who can leave comments or request further changes before merging it into the target branch.

Remember to refer to the specific documentation or guides for more detailed instructions on using these features in Git and GitHub.

### A GitHub README File

Adding a README file to your GitHub repository is the best way to introduce your project to others. Since it is usually the first thing others see on your repository, it is the best place to explain what your project does, why itâ€™s useful, and how they can get started with it.

A good README file in GitHub, at minimum, contains the following elements:

- Title
- Description
- Features
- How to use
- Technologies
- Collaborators
- License

You can further level up your README file with markdown:

- Use headers and HTML to format your README and make it easier to read.
- The headers automatically generate a table of contents on GitHub!
- Use media, such as images and videos, to make your project look more appealing.
