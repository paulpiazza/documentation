For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>
```

In the example above, setting the target attribute to "_blank" instructs the browser to open the relevant Wikipedia page in a new window.
