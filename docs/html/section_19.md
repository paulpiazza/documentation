Thankfully, HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, itâ€™s possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the <img> element with an `<a>` element.

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.Prickly_Pear_Closeup.jpg" alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/></a>
```

In the example above, an image of a prickly pear has been turned into a link by wrapping the outside of the <img> element with an `<a>` element.
