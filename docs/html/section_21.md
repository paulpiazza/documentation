What makes the example below difficult to read?

```html
<body><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body>
```

You have to read the entire line to know what elements are present. Compare the example above to this:

```html
<body>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
</body>
```

This example is easier to read, because each element is on its own line.
