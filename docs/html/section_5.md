You can also style text using HTML tags. The `<em>` tag emphasizes text, while the `<strong>` tag highlights important text.

Later, when you begin to style websites, you will decide how you want browsers to display content within `<em>` and `<strong>` tags. Browsers, however, have built-in style sheets that will generally style these tags in the following ways:

* The `<em>` tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
* The `<strong>` will generally render as bold emphasis.
