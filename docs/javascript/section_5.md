Here are the main data types in JavaScript and their explanations:

- Number: Used to represent numeric values like 1, 2, 3.14, etc. Can be integers, floats, infinity, or NaN (not a number).

- String: Used to represent textual data. Defined by enclosing in single or double quotes like 'hello' or "hello world". an use backticks (\`) for template literals.

- Boolean: Logical data type that can be either true or false. 

- Undefined: Default value assigned to variables that are declared but not yet assigned a value.

- Null: Intentional absence of a value. Denotes no value or null reference.

- Symbol: Unique and immutable primitive new to ES6. Used as unique object keys.

- Object (literal): Key-value collection of related data. Can contain properties and methods.

- Array: Ordered collection of data indexed by numbers. Arrays are objects.

- Function: Reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are objects.

- Date: Object that represents a date and time. Can perform date arithmetic. 

- RegExp: Used for matching patterns in strings via regular expressions.

- Error: Represents an error that occurs in code. Can be caught using try/catch.

- Map/Set: ES6 collection types - store key-value pairs and unique values respectively.

* BigInt - Used for larger integers beyond Number precision. Created with n suffix.

* Promise - Represents eventual completion of an async operation.

So in summary, the main datatypes are numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, functions. And null, undefined represent absence of value.
