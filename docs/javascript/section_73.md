title: What is an HTTP Security Header?

HTTP responses can contain headers with extra information that tells the client (browser) how to behave. Security-related headers are added in server-to-client responses to reflect a policy that the website wants to implement, like enforcing HTTPS communications over HTTP, or limiting whether a browser is allowed to render the current webpage in an iframe on another site.

Security headers help protect both the web application and the user. They can help prevent web attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It’s important to stay updated about these headers and configure them server-side.

Having security headers configured well also increases a website’s trustworthiness, which in turn makes it rank higher in web searches (SEO).

Take a look at the headers on the HTTP response from `www.codecademy.com` when the homepage is loaded. The security-related headers are highlighted.

Note that all headers are name-value pairs, with additional parameters following a semicolon `;`.

### Common Security Headers

Web security professionals should balance security and usability when deciding which ones to implement! Which security headers should one start with? We’ll discuss some of the most common ones.

### `Strict-Transportation-Security`

This header lets the server tell the browser that only the HTTPS version of the requested site is available. This enforces the use of HTTPS, which is encrypted compared to plain HTTP, ensuring that all communication between the client and the server occurs on a more secure transport layer.

This helps stop Man-In-the-Middle attacks. Let’s say someone is at a cafe using the shared wifi, accessing their bank website using HTTP instead of HTTPS. This means sensitive data coming from that device could easily be spied on, read, and even manipulated. If the bank’s web server includes the `Strict-Transport-Security` header in the HTTP response, the attack is much less likely to happen in this situation!

Here’s an example of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

Let’s break it down:

- The `includeSubDomains` value tells the browser that the current site, including all of its sub-domains, is HTTPS-only.
- The `max-age` field tells the browser to remember this for the next year (31536000 seconds = 1 year), reducing redirect responses to the HTTPS version of the site in the future.

Learn more in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security).

### `Content-Security-Policy`

`Content-Security-Policy` defines an allowlist of sources of content. This restricts the assets that the browser can load while they’re on the current website. This can prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where scripts from sources outside the site are executed.

Here’s an example of the `Content-Security-Policy` header:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
```

The `script-src` option restricts which resources JavaScript can be loaded from. The `self` value indicates that the browser should only run scripts from the current domain.

You can look into [more options for this header on Mozilla MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

### `X-Frame-Options`

This header stops the current page from being hidden in an `<iframe>` tag in another site’s HTML. This helps prevent [clickjacking](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking); a situation where an attacker loads your webpage in an iframe, hides the iframe using CSS, and tricks a user into unknowingly clicking on and sending a request to your webpage.

The CSS actually hides the Pay button that would likely redirect the user without them even knowing.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/content/paths/web-security/security-headers/clickjacking-alphabg.gif)

Here are some examples of the `X-Frame-Options` header that help prevent this type of attack:

```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

means your page can’t be hidden in an iframe anywhere, whereas

```
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

only allows this page to be put into an iframe within your own domain.

```
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://example.com
```

lets you list sites that are allowed to put the current content in an iframe.

### More Headers & Resources

Some other common headers include:

- [X-Content-Type-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options)
- [Referrer-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)

Fill in the blank

Fill in the blank code so that the security header tells the browser to:

- Remember to enforce HTTPS-only for the site for two years
- Only load content whose source is the same domain
- Not render ANY iframing of the current page

```
Strict-Transportation-Security: max-age=: default-src: self;X-Frame-Options: 
```

- I-Frame
- 31536000
- 63072000
- SAMEORIGIN
- Content-Security-Policy
- DENY
- X-XSS-Protection

### How to Add Security Headers

Headers can be added and removed in configuration files for servers. Below, we add the same header on three common types of servers: nginx, Apache, and Windows.

#### nginx

The following line is added to an nginx server’s config file to add the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to all HTTP responses.

```
add_header strict-transport-security 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains always;'
```

For more details, here is an [nginx guide to adding the Strict-Transport-Security header](https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-strict-transport-security-hsts-and-nginx/), which you can also use as a guide for adding other headers.

#### Apache:

To add the `Strict-Transport-Security` header, you can add the following line to Apache server’s config file located at `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:

```
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
```

#### Microsoft IIS

If you use Windows IIS, you can add security headers in your the `Web.config` file’s `<httpProtocol>` section like so:

```
<system.webServer>  ...  <httpProtocol>    <customHeaders>      <add name="Content-Security-Policy" value="default-src 'self';" />    </customHeaders>  </httpProtocol>  ...</system.webServer>
```

##### Checking Security Headers

You can use [https://securityheaders.com/](https://securityheaders.com/) to check which headers are active on your web address.
