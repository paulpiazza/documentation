You should not update the css directly with the JS script. It's better to update the class list of your HTML element. The class you add/remove from the class list of your HTML element has all the style needed. This is the rule in JS vanilla. this method can help you in maintaining css and js because the class you add with js is explicitly written in the js script.

React components can be styled in a number of different ways: inline styling, object variable styling, stylesheets, and CSS modules.

- Inline styling can be used to apply styles to a single element. Inline styling can be done by giving the element an attribute named `style` whose value is an object literal surrounded in curly braces.

```js
<h1 style={{color: "red"}}> Hello, World! </h1>
```

- An object variable can also be used to apply a style to a single element. The syntax is similar to inline styling, but rather than passing an object literal, the name of the variable is passed instead.

```js
const myStyle = { color: "red" }
<h1 style={myStyle}> Hello, World! </h1>
```

- Style names in React must be in camelCase. For example, `background-color` becomes `backgroundColor`.

- In React, a number style value is automatically interpreted with `px`.

- Styles can be separated and stored into CSS module files. The styles can be imported and used by applying `className` attributes to the relevant elements.

Example `styles.module.css`:

```css
/* styles.module.css */
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.title {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: #333;
}

.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

Example usage in React component:

```js
import React from 'react';
import styles from './styles.module.css'; // Import CSS module

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello, World!</h1>
      <button className={styles.button}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

```


The main difference between a regular CSS file and a CSS module file lies in how they handle the scoping and naming of CSS classes.

Regular CSS:

- In a regular CSS file, the styles you define apply globally across your entire application.
- Class names defined in a regular CSS file are not scoped to a specific component or module.
- There is a higher chance of style conflicts, as class names can clash between different components or modules.
- To differentiate between styles from different components, developers often use more specific class names or rely on naming conventions to avoid conflicts.

CSS modules:

- CSS modules provide a scoping mechanism, which means the styles you define are locally scoped to the component or module that imports them.
- Class names defined in a CSS module are transformed by the build tool into unique identifiers specific to that module, preventing naming clashes.
- You can use regular class names in a CSS module file, and the build tool will automatically generate unique class names at build time.
- When you import a CSS module into your code, you receive an object that maps the original class names to the unique identifiers generated by the CSS module system.
- By applying these class names as `className` attributes in your components, you can ensure that the styles defined in the CSS module are scoped to that component only.
- CSS modules improve modularity, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of style conflicts in complex applications.

In summary, while a regular CSS file provides global styles applicable throughout the application, CSS modules offer local scoping and unique class names to prevent style conflicts and enhance modularity within individual components or modules.
