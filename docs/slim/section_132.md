To implement authorization using Doctrine filters, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a custom filter class that implements the `Doctrine\ORM\Query\Filter\SQLFilter` interface. This filter will be responsible for applying the authorization logic to restrict data access based on certain criteria.

2. Implement the `addFilterConstraint` method in your custom filter class. This method will receive the SQL query and should modify it to include the necessary conditions for authorization.

3. Register the custom filter with the entity manager. You can do this by calling the `getFilters` method on the entity manager and adding your filter instance using the `addFilter` method.

4. Enable the filter for specific entities or entity mappings. You can use annotations, XML, or YAML mappings to specify which entities or entity mappings should be filtered using your custom filter. For example, you can add the `@Filter` annotation to entity classes or properties to enable the filter for those entities.

Here's an example implementation:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\ClassMetadata;
use Doctrine\ORM\Query\Filter\SQLFilter;

class AuthorizationFilter extends SQLFilter
{
    public function addFilterConstraint(ClassMetadata $targetEntity, $targetTableAlias)
    {
        // Implement your authorization logic here
        // Modify the SQL query to include authorization conditions
        
        // Example: Restrict access to entities with a specific role
        if ($targetEntity->getReflectionClass()->getName() === 'App\Entity\User') {
            return $targetTableAlias . '.role = "admin"';
        }
        
        return ''; // Return an empty string if no filtering is needed
    }
}
```

To enable the filter in your application:

```php
// Assuming $entityManager is your instance of EntityManager

// Create an instance of your custom filter
$authorizationFilter = new AuthorizationFilter();

// Register the filter with the entity manager
$entityManager->getFilters()->addFilter('authorization', $authorizationFilter);

// Enable the filter for specific entities or mappings using annotations, XML, or YAML
// For example, using annotations:
/**
 * @Entity
 * @Table(name="users")
 * @Filter("authorization")
 */
class User {
    // ...
}
```

By implementing and enabling the authorization filter, you can control data access at the entity level based on your custom logic.
