Sure, I can provide a summary of all PHP Standards Recommendations (PSRs) that have been approved by the PHP Framework Interop Group (FIG):

PSR-0: Autoloading Standard
PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard
PSR-2: Coding Style Guide (see PSR-12)
PSR-3: Logger Interface
PSR-4: Autoloader
PSR-5: PHPDoc Standard
PSR-6: Caching Interface
PSR-7: HTTP Message Interface
PSR-11: Container Interface
PSR-13: Hypermedia Links
PSR-14: Event Dispatcher
PSR-15: HTTP Handlers and Middleware
PSR-16: Simple Cache
PSR-17: HTTP Factories
PSR-18: HTTP Client

Each PSR has its own purpose and guidelines that help developers write code that is interoperable with other PHP code. You can find more information about each PSR on the FIG website or by searching for them online.
