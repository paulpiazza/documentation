Git is a command line software that keeps track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes made to a project, storing those changes, then allowing a programmer to reference them as needed.

All Git commands follow the pattern `git <action>` and, in order to use Git for a project, a project must first be initialized using the `git init` command in the project’s root directory.
