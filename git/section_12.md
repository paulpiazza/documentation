To add changes to the staging area in Git, you can use the `git add` command followed by the file or files you want to stage. This command prepares the changes to be included in the next commit.

```bash
$ git add index.html
```

These examples demonstrate some common Git commands and their usage. It's important to note that Git offers many more features and options beyond what is covered here. For more detailed information and advanced usage, you can refer to official Git documentation or other reliable resources.
