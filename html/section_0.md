## HTML Structure

HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content¹.

Here's a simple example of an HTML document structure¹:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the elements:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document¹.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page¹.
- `<head>`: Contains meta information about the HTML page¹.
- `<title>`: Specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)¹.
- `<body>`: Defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc¹.
- `<h1>`: Defines a large heading¹.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph¹.

Each HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: `<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>`¹. Some HTML elements have no content (like the `<br>` element). These elements are called empty elements and do not have an end tag¹.

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly¹. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document¹.
