One of the powerful aspects of HTML (and the Internet), is the ability to link to other web pages.

You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element `<a>` and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.

The anchor element in the example above is incomplete without the `href` attribute. This attribute stands for hyperlink reference and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located (whether it is on your computer or another location). The paths provided to the `href` attribute are often URLs.

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
```
