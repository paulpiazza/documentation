In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read list.

In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (`<ul>`) to create a list of items in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.

The `<ul>` element should not hold raw text and wonâ€™t automatically format raw text into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the `<li>` tag. The `<li>` or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.
