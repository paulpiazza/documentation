Pair programming is an agile software development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation. It's a collaborative approach where one, the "driver," writes code while the other, the "observer" or "navigator," reviews each line of code as it's typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

Here's a more detailed look at the roles:

- **Driver**: The driver is the person who physically writes the code. Their focus is on the tactical aspects of syntax and typing out the code properly.

- **Navigator**: The navigator takes on a more strategic role, thinking about the big picture, considering the overall structure and design of the code, and providing real-time feedback. The navigator also looks out for potential bugs and thinks about how the current work fits into the broader scope of the project.

The benefits of pair programming include:

- **Improved Code Quality**: Two sets of eyes on the code can lead to fewer bugs and better-designed code.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: It facilitates continuous knowledge transfer, with both participants learning from each other.
- **Mentorship**: It's an effective way for less experienced developers to learn from more experienced ones.
- **Team Building**: It can help build team cohesion and improve communication skills.
- **Problem-Solving Efficiency**: Pairs often solve complex problems faster than individuals working alone.

Pair programming is not without its challenges, such as potential for personality clashes or inefficiency if both programmers are not fully engaged. However, when done correctly, it can be a highly effective development practice.

#### Step 1: Learn about Pair-Programming

We have compiled the best resources to get you prepared to pair-program [here in this article](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/article-pair-programming-what-it-is-why-people-use-it-and-how-you-can-learn-to-pair-program/526299). Check it out! No need to read it all at once; this information is intended for reference.

#### Step 2: Find Someone to Pair-Program with

[Visit your group](http://codecademy.com/cohorts/front-end-engineer-career-path) and reply to the thread asking if anyone else is available to find a time to pair with you. Alternatively, reply to someone else who is looking for a collaborator. Another option is to seek out a partner in the [front-end-engineer channel in Codecademy’s Discord server](https://discord.gg/g5vzQCstyB).

When you arrive, be sure to introduce yourself with the following information:

- What % of the path you have completed
- What timezone or country you’re in
- One fun fact about yourself

#### Step 3: Meet with Your Partner

Coordinate to meet using tools like [Codecademy’s Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/codecademy) or feel free to DM a member of your group directly from the thread.

#### Step 4: Find Something to Pair on

Select what you would like to work on together. We suggest [profiling your own React application with Chrome’s profiler tool](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-advanced-web-development/modules/fecp-22-optimizing-your-application/articles/fecp-external-optimizing-your-react-application) then auditing your site with [Lighthouse](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-advanced-web-development/modules/fecp-22-optimizing-your-application/external_resources/fecp-external-using-lighthouse). With a partner, apply at least 5 [techniques to improve load times](https://web.dev/explore/fast), then audit your site with Lighthouse again. This will help you to identify and fix inefficiencies in your web apps. Alternatively, solve a [code challenge](https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges) or come up with your own personal project.
