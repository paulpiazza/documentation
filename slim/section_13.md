An expression is a combination of variables, values, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a single value.

PHP is an expression-oriented language.

Literal refers to a notation that represents a fixed value in source code. It is a way to directly express a specific value of a certain type, such as numbers, strings, booleans, characters, or even more complex data structures like arrays and objects. Literals are used to assign constant values to variables or to provide explicit values directly within expressions or statements.

```php
// 5 is a literal that evaluates to itself
$x = 5; // an integer literal
$text = "hello"; // a string literal

// x evaluates to 5
$y = $x;
```
