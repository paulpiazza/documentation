In PHP, the implementation of common connectors from UML involves creating classes that establish different types of relationships between objects. Let's take a look at how you can implement some of the common connectors:

1. **Association**:
Association represents a simple relationship between two classes. It can be implemented by creating instances of the related classes within each other.

```php
class Book {
    // ...
}

class Author {
    // ...
    
    public function writeBook(Book $book) {
        // Logic to associate an author with a book
    }
}

$book = new Book();
$author = new Author();
$author->writeBook($book);
```

2. **Aggregation** and **Composition**:
Aggregation and composition relationships are used to represent whole-part relationships. Here's an example of aggregation:

```php
class Engine {
    // ...
}

class Car {
    protected $engine;

    public function __construct(Engine $engine) {
        $this->engine = $engine;
    }
}
```

3. **Inheritance (Generalization)**:
Inheritance represents a relationship between a superclass and a subclass. The subclass inherits properties and methods from the superclass.

```php
class Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        // ...
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // ...
}
```

4. **Realization**:
Realization represents that a class implements an interface. In PHP, you achieve this through class inheritance and implementing interfaces.

```php
interface Shape {
    public function calculateArea();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public function calculateArea() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

5. **Dependency**:
Dependency represents a weak relationship where one class uses the services of another class temporarily. It's typically represented by method parameters.

```php
class PaymentProcessor {
    public function processPayment(Order $order) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

6. **Association Class Connector**:
You can use an association class to represent a class that plays a role in an association relationship.

```php
class Student {
    // ...
}

class Course {
    // ...
}

class Enrollment {
    protected $student;
    protected $course;

    public function __construct(Student $student, Course $course) {
        $this->student = $student;
        $this->course = $course;
    }
}
```

These are simplified examples of how you can implement common connectors in PHP. Keep in mind that UML is a modeling language, and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements of your application. The goal is to model the relationships accurately to represent the desired behavior and interactions between objects.
